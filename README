dmChosenSelectPlugin is missing add on for Diem. It provides you with cool selects for loooooong list of items.

Where can be used?
---------------
It is mentioned to be used for the admin part of the application, but since it contains widgets, it is fully compatible for front part of the application.

How to use it?
---------
In your schema.yml add "chosen" for the select fields that you want for the admin.

For the front application, use provided widgets, and that's all

How does it works?
---------
Simple, hides symfony select fields, adds text box and javascript that manages hidden fields values. Simple, huh?

What is different?
---------
Everything! The concept is different - javascript is just a presentation of Symfony select, we do not touch that, we are just presenting a new UI. 

Localization?
---------
Of course! Automated!

To whom to say thanks?
---------
To TheCelavi :)

TODO?
---------
There is no much support for IE :( too bad...
